# XMesh

XMesh is a mesh network protocol for communication via nodes powered by small solar cells.

## solar challenge

I developed this protocol to be able to access remote sensors via repeaters. A repeater requires on average only 1 mA current to be supplied with sufficient energy even in cloudy conditions or via a lamp. The advantage of solar cells is that the repeater does not require a power supply or batteries.
